Q Machine
=========

[Q Machine](http://qmachine.org) is a web service that uses
[Quanah](http://wilkinson.github.com/quanah) to act as a "supercomputer" for
running scientific computations using only web browsers and
[CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/). I have also written a "port" to
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) that uses [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) for
its persistent storage mechanism. I am currently writing several papers about
Quanah and Q Machine, but I promise I will write more documentation soon!

There are several "mirrors" available on
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/wilkinson/qmachine),
[GitHub](https://github.com/wilkinson/qmachine), and
[Google Code](https://qmachine.googlecode.com).

I have done some preliminary investigation into app integration for

-   [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meagomakeegjimdibmlodmilfhplkjgp?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon)
-   [Facebook](http://apps.facebook.com/qmachine/)
-   [Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/apps/1755018/)

In the future, I would like to integrate Q Machine with "app ecosystems" like

-   [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps)
-   [DirecTV](http://tvapps.directv.com/)
-   [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/)
-   [ePrintCenter](https://h30495.www3.hp.com/apps/)
-   [Kynetx](http://developer.kynetx.com/)
-   [iOS](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/)
