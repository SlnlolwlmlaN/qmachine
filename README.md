Qmachine
========

[Qmachine](http://qmachine.org) is a web service that uses
[Quanah](http://wilkinson.github.com/quanah) to act as a "supercomputer" for
running scientific computations using only web browsers and CouchDB. I am
currently writing several papers about Quanah and Qmachine, but I promise I
will write more documentation here soon!

There are several "mirrors" available on
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/wilkinson/qmachine),
[GitHub](https://github.com/wilkinson/qmachine), and
[Google Code](https://qmachine.googlecode.com).
