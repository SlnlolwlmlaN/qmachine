Qmachine
========

[Qmachine](http://qmachine.org) is a web service that uses
[Quanah](http://wilkinson.github.com/quanah) to act as a "supercomputer" for
running scientific computations using only web browsers and
[CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/). I have also written a "port" to
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) that uses [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) for
its persistent storage mechanism. I am currently writing several papers about
Quanah and Qmachine, but I promise I will write more documentation soon!

There are several "mirrors" available on
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/wilkinson/qmachine),
[GitHub](https://github.com/wilkinson/qmachine), and
[Google Code](https://qmachine.googlecode.com).

I would also like to "port" QMachine, as an app, to other social platforms like
Android, Facebook, IOS, Twitter, and even DropBox :-)
