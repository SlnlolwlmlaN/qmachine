README --

Having created YOURSERVER, a fresh Ubuntu Lucid machine on Rackspace, you can
deploy CouchDB over HTTPS in just three steps.

First, login to YOURSERVER using your favorite SSH client:
    $ ssh root@YOURSERVER

Second, download the automated configuration script by typing the following:
    # curl http://quanah.googlecode.com/hg/nginx-ssl/Makefile -o Makefile

Finally, run the automated setup:
    # make

The final step in the automated setup will reboot the machine, which will cause
your SSH session to terminate. Do not be alarmed -- this is normal! During the
install, however, you will have created another administrator account, and that
second account is the one you will need to use to connect to your server after
it finishes rebooting.
