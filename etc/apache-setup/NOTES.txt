In order to simulate the CouchOne hosting environment, I am going to use the
Apache webserver to provide a reverse proxy to CouchDB over port 80 so that I
don't have to mess with CouchDB's port directly. That way, it will still be
available on 5984 if I mess something up.

1.  Find /etc/apache2/httpd.conf and uncomment the lines there to match this:
        # Virtual hosts
        Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

2.  Find /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf and completely replace the text
    content with the following:
        <VirtualHost *:80>
            ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
            ProxyRequests Off
            <Proxy *>
                Order Allow,Deny
                Allow from all
            </Proxy>
            RewriteEngine on
            RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://127.0.0.1:5984/$1 [QSA,P]
        </VirtualHost>

3.  Start the built-in Apache2 httpd on Snow Leopard :-)
        $ sudo apachectl start

By using the instructions as shown above, you don't even need to use "vhosts"
in CouchDB itself, and that's nice because they're not documented very well.

One change I _did_ make to CouchDB's configuration, though, was to enable JSONP
by heading to the Tools:Configuration page and changing "httpd > allow_jsonp"
to "true".

Additionally, I visited localhost:5984/_utils, went to Tools:Configuration, and
then added "vhosts: {localhost: /app/_design/quanah/_rewrite}" (not literally).
